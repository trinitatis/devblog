I launch this blog with [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) together with help from [jekyllthemes](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hacker-blog/).

I'm complete newbie and even this thing was not easy for me.

I caught a some errors while I was trying to make friends Jekyll and Windows.  
For example  
<font style="color:white; background:black">Invalid byte sequence in UTF-8</font>

2021-01-22 I created an account on GitHub. And watched some video about Git on YouTube.
