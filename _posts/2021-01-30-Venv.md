I had a little time to study tonigth.  
I like <font color=cyan>Python</font>, despite the fact that its prospects are not clear.  
I started to figure out the environment. In particular with <font color=cyan>*virtualenv*</font>  
and the work of Atom in virtual environment.  
* * *
I use Windows.

Check which modules are installed in the system:  
<font style="color:white; background:black">d:\mypy\python -m pydoc modules
</font>

Creation of virtual environments:  
<font style="color:white; background:black">d:\mypy\python -m venv first_test --system-site-packages --without-pip</font>

Activate virtual environment *first_test*:
```
d:\mypy>cd first_test  
d:\mypy\first_test>Scripts\activate  
< first_test > d:\mypy\first_test>  
```
Now, to run Atom in environment *first_test*, need to start it from terminal:  
```
< first_test > d:\mypy\first_test>\<path to Atom>atom.exe
```
* * *
I created a simple script to check what environment Atom is in:
```python
print(sys.prefix) # point to the current base directory
print(sys.base_prefix) # point to the system base directory of the non-virtual environment
```
In *non-virtual* environment the output of the script is the same values:  
```
D:\Python  
D:\Python
```

In *virtual* environment the output of the script is:  
```
d:\mypy\first_test  
D:\Python
```
* * *
For convenience, I have installed two packages in Atom:  
``` python
script #allows you to run the script in the internal Atom terminal; doesn't support console input  
atom-python-run #allows you to run the script in terminal similar to IDLE-terminal; support console input
```
